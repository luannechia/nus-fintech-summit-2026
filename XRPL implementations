Here are some of the XRPL features and their implementations in our project, and why we used them.

1) XRPL Testnet & Wallets
The application connects to the XRP Ledger Testnet using a JSON-RPC client.
Two on-chain wallets are programmatically created and funded via the XRPL faucet:
Client wallet (payer)
Freelancer wallet (payee)

This project demonstrates real, self-custodied wallets and on-ledger identities without financial intermediaries. While traditional 
platforms rely on corporate policies to ensure users get paid, this system uses on-chain escrows to cryptographically guarantee proof 
of funds. This replaces the need for blind trust with mathematical verification.


2) On-Chain Escrow
The client locks funds in an XRPL Escrow object using EscrowCreate.
Escrow parameters:
Destination: freelancer wallet
Amount: fixed payment amount
FinishAfter: earliest time funds can be released
CancelAfter: deadline for refund if the job fails

Escrow ensures funds are pre-funded and trustlessly locked, removing payment risk for freelancers, solving counterparty risk.

3) Escrow Completion & Instant Settlement
Once the finish condition is met, the client submits an EscrowFinish transaction.
Funds are released instantly to the freelancer’s wallet.

This achieves instant payment upon task completion, directly addressing delayed freelancer payouts, highlighting the ability of on-chain
transactions to be fast and seamless.

4) On-Ledger Transparency & Verifiability
All actions produce real XRPL transaction hashes.
Balances before and after escrow execution are retrieved from the ledger.
Transactions can be independently verified via the XRPL Testnet Explorer.

Payments are auditable, irreversible, and trust-minimized, showing validity and transparency, mitigating potential hidden platform
fees.

Overall, we believe that the incorporation of XRPL features in the gig economy would greatly enhance the current state of it, fixing its biggest flaws. 
By making payments fast, transparent, and secure, we can protect freelancers and create a fairer system for everyone, without needing a middleman to 
manage the money.
